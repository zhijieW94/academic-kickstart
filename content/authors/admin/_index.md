I am a Research Assistant in the [Visual Computing Center](https://vcc.tech/index.html) ([VCC](https://vcc.tech/index.html)) led by [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). Currently, I closely cooperate with [Prof. Daniel Cohen-Or](http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/), [Prof. Dani Lischinski](http://danix3d.droppages.com/), [Prof. Minglun Gong](http://www.cs.mun.ca/~gong/) and [Prof. Hui Huang](https://vcc.tech/~huihuang). Before joining VCC, I received my Bachelor degree with distinction in Computer Science at Sichuan University. And then I worked at DJ-Innovations as software developers. Later as a Research Assistant, I worked with Prof. Jin Qin on mesh processing.

My areas of research recently lie in computer graphics-based deep learning application, including 3D generative models, geometry processing, arbitrary style transfer and image generation.
